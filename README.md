## Overview

Welcome to the JavaScript Technical Documentation Page project! This repository contains a responsive web page that serves as a documentation for JavaScript, showcasing my skills in responsive web design and HTML/CSS coding. It's part of the final project for the Responsive Web Design course with Freecodecamp.
